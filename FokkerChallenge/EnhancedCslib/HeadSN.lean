# The Head Normalization Theorem

The **head normalization theorem** (Barendregt, *The Lambda Calculus*,
Corollary 11.4.8; Takahashi, *Parallel reductions in λ-calculus*, Corollary
2.7): if a term has a head normal form, then its *head reduction* reaches a head
normal form — in particular the head reduction terminates.

The proof follows Takahashi: every parallel β-reduction factors as a head
reduction followed by an *internal* parallel reduction (`parBeta_head_internal`,
the Main Lemma of `RequestProject.StarSeq`), and internal parallel reduction
reflects head normal forms (`IPar.headNF_back`).

Main results:

* `head_normalization`   — `M ↠β N`, `N` a head normal form ⟹ `M ⟶h* P` with
  `P` a head normal form;
* `hasHNF_iff_headStepStar_headNF` — `M` has a head normal form iff head
  reduction from `M` reaches one;
* `HeadStep.deterministic` — head reduction is deterministic;
* `head_normalization_theorem` — for locally closed `M`: `M` has a head normal
  form iff head reduction from `M` terminates;
* `no_infinite_head_reduction` — a term with a head normal form admits no
  infinite head reduction sequence.
